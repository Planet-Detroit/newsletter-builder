### 2.2 News Curation Integration - "What We're Reading"

- [ ] Recommendation: **Option B for MVP**, migrate to C later

### 2.3 CO2 Widget
- [ ] Fetch current CO2 from NOAA/Scripps Mauna Loa data
- [ ] Compare to same date last year
- [ ] Link to "What was CO2 when you were born" calculator

---

## Phase 3: AI-Generated Intro (Week 2)

### 3.1 Intro Generation
- [ ] Collect all content for the newsletter (PD stories, curated news, events)
- [ ] Send to Gemini API with prompt to generate 2-3 paragraph intro
- [ ] Prompt should:
  - Identify the top 2-3 themes of the week
  - Write in Nina's voice (conversational, informed, locally-focused)
  - Reference specific stories with bold text for key names/places
  - End with "read on to learn what else caught our attention..."
- [ ] Generate 2-3 variations for editor to choose from
- [ ] Editable text area for final tweaks

### 3.2 Subject Line Generator
- [ ] Generate 3-5 subject line options based on intro
- [ ] Include emoji options (⭐ for featured, relevant emoji for topic)
- [ ] Character count indicator

---

## Phase 4: Events & Jobs (Week 2-3)

### 4.1 CitySpark Events Integration
- [ ] Research CitySpark API or scraping approach
- [ ] Fetch upcoming environmental/community events in Metro Detroit

- [ ] Select which events to feature (typically 2-3)
- [ ] Add Planet Detroit's own events manually or from WordPress

### 4.2 Jobs Section - Two Options

**Option A: Keep WordPress Plugin (Simpler)**
- [ ] Scrape/fetch from https://planetdetroit.org/jobs-2/
- [ ] Display in dashboard for selection
- [ ] Select 2-3 to feature

**Option B: Build Jobs Management System (Better long-term)**
- [ ] Simple admin interface to add/edit/remove jobs
- [ ] Fields: Organization, Title, URL, Description, Date Posted, Expiration
- [ ] Auto-expire old listings
- [ ] Could replace WordPress plugin entirely
- [ ] API to display on planetdetroit.org/jobs-2/ (future)

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A, build Option B as lower-priority enhancement

---

- [ ] Each ad slot has:
  - Name/label

## Questions to Resolve

1. **CitySpark API access** - Do you have API credentials, or will we need to scrape?
2. **ActiveCampaign API** - Do you want direct integration, or is copy/paste HTML sufficient for now?
3. **Jobs automation** - How often do jobs get updated? Is the WordPress plugin working well enough?
4. **Email template** - Do you have the current HTML template from ActiveCampaign we can use as a base?
5. **Authentication** - Should this tool require login, or is it internal-only on a private URL?

---

## Existing Tool Updates (news-brief-generator)

Before starting the new project, complete these minor fixes:

- [x] Add About section with instructions
- [x] Newsletter output includes "Learn more" link to WordPress post
- [ ] Push latest commits to GitHub (blocked by git lock file - run these commands in terminal)

---

## To Fix Git Lock Issue

Run these commands in your terminal in the news-brief-generator folder:

```bash
cd ~/projects/news-brief-generator
rm -f .git/index.lock
rm -f .git/HEAD.lock
rm -f .git/*.lock
find .git -name "*.lock" -delete
find .git -name "tmp_obj_*" -delete
```

Then commit and push:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add About section, newsletter Learn more link, and cheerio type fix"
git push
```

---

## Next Session Checklist

To continue development in a fresh conversation:

1. Share this plan file
2. Confirm answers to the questions above
3. Decide: Start with new project, or enhance existing tool first?
4. Provide any existing email HTML template from ActiveCampaign
5. Provide CitySpark access details if available

## Email to Dustin (Draft)

**Subject:** New News Curation Tool - Replacing the Desktop App

Hi Dustin,

I've set up a new web-based tool for the weekly news curation: https://news-brief-generator.vercel.app/

**How to use it:**

1. **Paste** — Open the [Planet Detroit News Curator Gem](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1k53wHUaIr5cMHEpNkwaX_GwbNblNEacs) in Gemini, type "run", then paste the output into the tool
2. **Review** — Drag to reorder stories, delete any you don't want, add articles by URL (or paste text for paywalled content)
3. **SEO** — AI generates headline suggestions and meta descriptions. Pick one or customize.
4. **Image** — Search iStock for a featured image. The tool auto-generates alt text and captions.
5. **Publish** — Creates a WordPress draft with everything in one click
6. **Newsletter** — Copy the formatted text for ActiveCampaign (includes a "Learn more" link)

Click the ℹ️ About button in the tool header for these instructions anytime.

**For Brian:** He should continue to suggest stories, but he no longer needs to submit a list of links each week. The Gemini Gem handles the initial curation, and you can add/remove stories as needed in the Review step.

This tool replaces the desktop app I installed previously. I'm working on expanding it into a full newsletter builder that will eventually replace the WordPress Newspack newsletter tool entirely — including auto-generating the intro, pulling in Planet Detroit stories, events from CitySpark, and jobs.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Nina
